# Fullstack Project

Now that you've got an understanding of full-stack web development fundamentals, it's time to take some time and build a project on your own. The sky's the limit: you can build a cool game, an application based on an idea you've been kicking around, or a better version of something you've found online. 

To help provide you with some structure as you think about your project, here are some requirements along with some optional nice-to-have features:

### Requirements

Your project MUST satisfy the following requirements:

* It MUST be a full-stack web application which uses a database for some form of persistence. You've graduated from projects that only have a front-end.
* Your app MUST be deployed on Heroku (remember: deployed apps are a prerequisite for admission to Outco!).
* Your app has to look good. Feel free to use Bootstrap to help with this, or research another library you can use to help style your application. Remember: non-technical people won't care how complex your backend is if your project looks like garbage.
* Your app must include a README which explains how to get the app running locally, what technologies you've used, and why you decided to build the project.

### Nice-to-haves

* One (or more!) of the following:
    1. Authentication/authorization of users
    2. Something involving web-scraping.
    3. Research some other library (either JavaScript or Python) that we haven't studied in class. There's always more to learn, and a project is a great way to try to get a handle on some technology you're curious about!
* A more complex database schema (many-to-many, anyone??).

You can choose to work solo on a project or pair with someone else. You're encouraged to pair, since you'll be able to build more in a week with two people working on the same project, but this isn't required.

### Submission

When your app is deployed, put a link to it in the [applications](./applications.md) readme.
